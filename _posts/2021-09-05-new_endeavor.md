Hi All,

I am an SQL & PL/SQL Developer mainly developing custom solutions and interfaces in the Oracle ERP landscape. I have around 15 years of experience in working with SQL & PL/SQL. I have also consulted on the extended space of MYSQL, SQL Server & PostgreSQL and in personal projects. I started looking at Oracle 19c as requirement for a new upgrade project & MongoDB for a personal Project and I decided that it will be a good practice to document what I have learned all these years in my projects and the new things I keep finding about. For example, I recently learned about the **info+** command in SQL to get object details (an advanced form of **desc** & **info** commands). Since I mainly use Tools like SQL Developer and Toad for interacting with the Database, you miss out on these commands sometimes as these GUI based tools does provide a better and more deeper look at objects than any of these commands as they consolidate multiple commands.

I am looking forward to this process of documenting my learning for myself and the world. This is a promise to myself which I believe I will be able to keep.

Regards,
Sandeep
